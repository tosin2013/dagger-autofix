# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the Dagger GitHub Actions Auto-Fix Agent project (https://github.com/tosin2013/dagger-autofix-.git) authored by Tosin Akinosho (tosin.akinosho@gmail.com). The pipeline will provide automated building, testing, security scanning, and deployment capabilities with a focus on achieving and maintaining 85%+ test coverage for all releases. The solution will include multiple workflow configurations to support different development scenarios including pull requests, releases, and continuous integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines that build and test my code on every push and pull request, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code to any branch THEN the system SHALL trigger a build and test workflow
2. WHEN a pull request is created or updated THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive tests including unit, integration, and security scans
3. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL report build status and test results as GitHub status checks
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging and provide detailed failure information
5. IF the target branch is main or master THEN the system SHALL require all status checks to pass before allowing merge

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to enforce 85% minimum test coverage on all releases, so that we maintain high code quality and reliability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive coverage reports for all Go packages
2. WHEN coverage is calculated THEN the system SHALL include unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests
3. WHEN coverage falls below 85% THEN the system SHALL fail the build and prevent release
4. WHEN coverage meets or exceeds 85% THEN the system SHALL generate coverage badges and reports
5. WHEN a release is created THEN the system SHALL validate that coverage requirements are met before proceeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want automated security scanning in the CI pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are detected and addressed before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run static security analysis using gosec or similar tools
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL scan for known vulnerabilities using govulncheck
3. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL fail the build and provide detailed vulnerability reports
4. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL scan container images for security vulnerabilities
5. IF critical vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL block deployment and notify maintainers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated release workflows that build, test, and deploy artifacts, so that releases are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release tag is created THEN the system SHALL trigger an automated release workflow
2. WHEN building for release THEN the system SHALL compile binaries for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
3. WHEN release artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL generate checksums and sign binaries
4. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL tag them appropriately and push to container registry
5. WHEN release is complete THEN the system SHALL create GitHub release with artifacts and changelog
6. WHEN publishing to Daggerverse THEN the system SHALL support automated publishing via https://daggerverse.dev/publish

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test execution that covers unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios, so that I can be confident in code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run all unit tests with race condition detection
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL test against real GitHub API and LLM providers using test credentials
3. WHEN end-to-end tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate complete workflows including Dagger module functionality
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed test reports with timing and coverage information
5. IF any test category fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear failure categorization and debugging information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project contributor, I want fast feedback on code changes through optimized CI workflows, so that development velocity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI workflows execute THEN the system SHALL complete basic checks within 5 minutes
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use parallel execution and caching to optimize performance
3. WHEN dependencies are unchanged THEN the system SHALL use cached dependencies to speed up builds
4. WHEN artifacts are built THEN the system SHALL cache build outputs for reuse in subsequent jobs
5. WHEN workflows run THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and clear status indicators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated quality gates and branch protection, so that only high-quality code reaches the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL require all CI checks to pass before allowing merge
2. WHEN code quality checks run THEN the system SHALL enforce linting, formatting, and code complexity standards
3. WHEN coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL require coverage to not decrease from the baseline
4. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL require no high or critical vulnerabilities
5. IF quality gates fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback for remediation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability of CI/CD pipelines, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL collect detailed metrics on build times, test execution, and resource usage
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logs and debugging information
3. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports and trend analysis
4. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL send notifications to relevant stakeholders
5. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL make them available through dashboards and APIs
